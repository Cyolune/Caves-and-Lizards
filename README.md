MS 1 - Ideation
We realised that there were many players who were interested in Dungeons and
Dragons, and wanted to try the game out. However, it was hard and confusing for
them to start from scratch, given the complexity and extremely user-dependent
nature of the game. As such, we aim to create a game to simplify the confusing
elements, offering an intuitive gameplay system that allows new users to pick 
the game up easily, introducing them to this genre of games.

We propose to have these features:
- Camera movement system 
- Player control system, including:
	- Movement
	- Attacking / Casting spells
	- Stats and progression
	- Gearing
- Coordinate-based world map
- Turn-based Combat
- GUI for display of information
- Short single-player campaign

By MS 1, we have done the following:
- Camera movement system (via WASD, Edge Panning, Right click rotate, scroll 
wheel zoom)
- Out of combat Player movement (Left click move, Right click cancel movement)
- Movement via shortest-path
- Crosshair/marker to denote where to the user is pointing at
- Simple combat start and stop (Starts a certain distance, stops when either
parties die)

By MS 2, we plan to do the following:
- Refined Combat including taking turns and a better combat start/stop system
- Character Stats, skills
- GUI component
- Simple Map Design
- Simple Character Models, Textures and Animations

By MS 3, we plan to do the following:
- Refining existing technologies and systems
- Game Balancing
- Short Campaign
